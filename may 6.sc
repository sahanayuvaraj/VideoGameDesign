my game is Solitaire which is a classic single-player card game usually played with a standard 52-card deck. The most well-known version is called Klondike Solitaire.
In this version, the main goal is to move all the cards into four foundation piles—one for each
suit: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Each pile must be built in order, starting with the Ace and going up to the King.
There’s also a stock pile (or draw pile), which holds the rest of the cards that weren’t placed in the tableau. You can flip through the stock pile to help find cards that you can play.
Winning the game takes strategy, patience, and sometimes a bit of luck, especially if you’re trying to clear the whole tableau and get all the cards into their correct foundation piles.
